#Say No to Free Basics
---------------------

This app is basic demonstration of **Authentication** in **NodeJS** using passport, using **MongoDB** as the datastore.

This app is a task at Google Code In, for FOSSASIA, this app also focusses on the concept of Net Neutrality, which is largely being flawed by Facebook's Free Basics, which claims to connect the country.

The app takes in the user info, and guides them in supporting Net Neutrality, by contacting the TRAI, also the app shows the other users that have pledged against Free Basic.

**Steps to Install and Running**

 1. Get your MongoDB Connection URL from your app hosting, or from **MongoLab**, or install MongoDB and run it locally, and paste it in the **database.js** folder in /**config**
 2. `git clone`
 3. `npm install`
 4. `node server.js` (`nodemon` is a better choice)
 5.  visit localhost:3000 (default) for the app.

Made with LOVE for FOSSASIA.
